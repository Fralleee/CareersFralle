# CareersFralle
A small C# .NET Core project for learning purposes.

## Why
The purpose is to learn technologies which I'm not that familiar with such as:
- Latest .NET Core
- Dependency injection
- ElasticSearch
- Redis
- Docker

## Todo
- Using stacks, make it similar to company pages
- Use Services and Repositories
- Dependency Injection
- Integrate elastic search 
- Add impression count and click tracking
- Use Redis as cache before batching to database
- Containerize/Docker the whole application
- Add tests
