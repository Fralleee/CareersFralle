A small C# .NET Core project for learning purposes.

## Why
The purpose is to learn technologies which I'm not that familiar with such as:
- Latest .NET Core
- Dependency injection
- ElasticSearch
- Redis
- Docker

## Todo
- Add click tracking for each post
  - Remove link, just track the click.
  - Use Redis as cache before batching to database
- Containerize/Docker the whole application
- Add tests
